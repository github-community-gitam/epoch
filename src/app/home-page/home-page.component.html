            University experiences. It is a two-day fest conducted by GitHub Community GITAM at
            GITAM University, Bangalore. This fest primarily focuses on
            promoting technology among students in GITAM.
            There are four main events - Technical Treasure Hunt, LAN Gaming,
            Product Commercial Videography, and Tech Trivia. These four events
            are conducted on all three campuses before the fest. Finalists in each
            event from each campus shall come to the Bangalore campus to
            compete with the other finalists from the other campuses.

        <p>
            GitHub Community GITAM (GCG) was founded in September 2021
            unofficially by a group of six like-minded individuals in GITAM
            Bangalore to promote technology and its importance in the university.
            In January 2022, GitHub Community GITAM was named an official SIG (Special Interest
            Group) under the Directorate of Student Life. From a group of six
            people, GitHub Community GITAM grew to be a community of over 350 people. It is known
            by students on all three campuses at Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad, and
            Bangalore. Our Mission is to facilitate an active and striving technical
            community on campus. We have a team of 25 working every day
            towards our mission.

        <p>
            Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management is a deemed to be a
            university in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. Founded by the late Dr
            M. V. V. S. Murthi in 1980 in Visakhapatnam, it also has campuses in
            Hyderabad and Bangalore.
            The Directorate of Student Life (DoSL) forms an integral part of the
            GITAM Campus Life team, which was created to bring a professional
            approach to handling campus functions outside of academic forums.
            The objective of Campus Life is to ensure that students have a high
            quality of living & learning experience on campus that allows them to
            develop holistically. Over the last few years, DoSL has incubated and
            mentored over 70+ student clubs & special interest groups. GITAM has
            a plethora of activities and events, which range from dance, music and
            theatre to coding hackathons, debates and community service. Each
            student organization works like a start-up and has a clear vision &
            objective.
